# Visual Studio Code snippets

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) allows you to use [Emmet](http://emmet.io/) style abbreviations and [custom snippets](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/editor/editingevolved#_snippets) to make development faster. This repository is a collection of my snippets for various languages.

Check out [Visual Studio COde Snippets](http://visualstudiocodesnippets.com/) for a cool project created by Fons Sonnemans and Dylan Hayes that allows users to share snippets with each other.
